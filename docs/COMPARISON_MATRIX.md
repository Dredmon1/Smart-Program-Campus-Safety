## Key SCS Differentiators

### 1. Unified Multi-Region Architecture
Unlike competitors that serve individual agencies, SCS connects **4 regions** (LA, OC, IE, SD) into a single command platform. Cross-jurisdictional pursuit handoff is automatic.

### 2. AI-Powered Prediction (Horizon API)
72-hour incident forecasting using historical data, weather, events, and traffic patterns. No competitor offers predictive intelligence as a standalone API product.

### 3. Flexible Pricing Model
Month-to-month contracts with per-node and per-seat pricing. Competitors typically require 1-5 year commitments with enterprise-wide licensing.

### 4. Full-Stack Product Suite
SCS is the only platform offering sensor integration (Shield), tactical response (IWIN), predictive intelligence (Horizon), security operations (CyberGuard), and training (TrainForce) in one ecosystem.

### 5. Open API Platform
RESTful API with WebSocket support enables third-party integrations, urban planning tools, insurance analytics, and autonomous vehicle routing — markets competitors don't address.
